## cam_sundaydriving
> A RP driving mode that you can toggle for smoother acceleration and a built in speed limiter 
based on which road you are on. With a simple press of one button you are no longer pulling away 
from traffic lights like a hooligan, having your engine scream at you on the highway or breaking 
the speed limit. Perfect if you want to drive in a more relaxed RP manner while using keyboard.

* ox_lib dependency
* Resmon:
 * 0.00ms while idle
 * 0.01~0.02ms with just rpm limiter
 * 0.02~0.03ms with speed limiter enabled aswell

I made this script after being inspired by kq_throttlecontrol and not liking how it held the RPM 
at one level thus making the car almost seem electric when it pulled away. I decided to have a 
crack at my own version where it limits how hard the car revs to allow smooth take offs and gentle 
driving without the engine screaming at ya. I also ended up building a speedlimiter into it which 
changes based on the speed limit of the road that are you on. In the show case you can see how the 
car is limited to a different speed as it changes roads
